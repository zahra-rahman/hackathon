# LAT HACKS 20201

<p> My programs are based on the theme of productivity. Research shows that people spend over 5 days in total every year trying to choose an outfit. This could be made easier with a program that makes it for you</p>

<p> My project was inspired by one of my favourite chickflicks, Clueles. The main charcter Cher has an online automatic wardrobe which creates outfits for her. When it comes to programming, I know a bit of python and a bit of html, so I put these together to make my own version of this, made specfically for my client Cher</p>

<p> Initally, I made a simple python program, where it asks for your name. If you are either Cher or one of her friends Dion or Tai, it'll show you the weather today (so you know to wrap up warm or wear suncream) and a random outfit from a list of choices to match this. To do this I used conditional statements and imported a package called pandas which allowed me to create my own weather data using a dictionary and make this into a dataframe. I also used the random package to give me random choices</p>

<p>I then spent a few hours trying to figure out how to use tkinter. On a pop up window, you are asked your name and the date. With the correct name and a given date, you are taken to another window on top of this which has subsetted information from the weather data from the pandas dataframe. As well as this there is a button that takes you you to a html website of that days outfit. </p>
  
<p> On the webstie, you can again see the weather and what specific outfit should be worn as well as photos with it. The site is very bright and colourful as I thought this matched the personality of the client. Underneath this there are acessories to help add to the look. When hovering over this there is a translucent overlay, which adds extra color to the whole site. You could also see tomorrows forecast and outfit in addition lookbook of Cher's favourite outfits from the film</p>
