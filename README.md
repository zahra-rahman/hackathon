# LAT HACKS 20201

<p> My programs are based on the theme of productivity. Research shows that people spend over 5 days in total every year trying to choose an outfit. This could be made easier with a program that makes it for you</p>

<p> My project was inspired by one of my favourite chickflicks, Clueles. The main charcter Cher has an online automatic wardrobe which creates outfits for her</p>

<p> Initally, I made a simple python program, where it asks for your name. If you are the correct person, it'll show you the weather today (so you know to wrap up warm) and a outfit to match this</p>

<p>I then spent a few hours trying to figure out how to use tkinter. With this, I made a pandas dataframe using a dictionary. This told you the weather of today and took you to a html website of that days outfit. On the webstie, you could also see tomorrows forecast as well as a lookbook of Cher's favourite outfits from the film </p>
